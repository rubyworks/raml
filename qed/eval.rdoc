= RAML.eval

The RAML.eval() method parses a RAML document using the Kernel.eval.
In this way Ruby scripting can still be utilized within the document.

Require the RAML library.

  require 'raml'

Given a RAML document:

  website "http://rubygems.org"

We can load the text via the #load method. (Note above document text has
been placed in the @text variable.)

  data = RAML.eval(@text)

  data.assert == {:website=>"http://rubygems.org"}

One of the nicer features of RAML derives from Ruby's block notation, allowing
for nested entries.

Given a RAML document:

  resources do
    home "http://rubyworks.github.com/raml"
    docs "http://rubyworks.github.com/raml/docs/api"
    wiki "http://wiki.rubyworks.github.com/raml"
  end

We get a two layer hash.

  data = RAML.eval(@text)

  data[:resources][:home].assert == "http://rubyworks.github.com/raml"
  data[:resources][:docs].assert == "http://rubyworks.github.com/raml/docs/api"
  data[:resources][:wiki].assert == "http://wiki.rubyworks.github.com/raml"

RAML is also considers the content of a block. If it is a scalar entry,
such as a String, then that will be assigned to the key.

Given a RAML document:

  description %{
    This is a description.
    It can have multiple lines.
    RAML handles this just fine,
    because Ruby does too.
  }

Loading this document, description will contain the text as expected.

  data = RAML.eval(@text)

  text = data[:description].sub(/\s+/, ' ').strip

  text.assert.start_with?("This is")
  text.assert.end_with?("does too.")

It is only unfortunate that Ruby doesn't have a margin controlled string
notation (e.g. `%L{ }`) so that post processing with `sub()` would not
be neccessary.

RAML has some options that makes it more flexible than many other data
lanaguages. For instance, it can allow for multi-key entries.

Given a RAML document:

  source "http://rubygems.org"
  gem "facets", "~> 2.8"
  gem "ansi", "~> 1.1"

We simply need to inform the loader to allow identical keys.

  data = RAML.eval(@text, :multikey=>true)

  data.assert == {
    :source=>"http://rubygems.org",
    :gem=>[["facets", "~> 2.8"],["ansi", "~> 1.1"]]
  }

If we did not turn on the multi-key option, then the last `gem` entry
would have simply overwritten the former.

  data = RAML.eval(@text)

  data.assert == {
    :source=>"http://rubygems.org",
    :gem=>["ansi", "~> 1.1"]
  }

Not let's show-off the benefit of using RAML.eval instead of RAML.load.

Given a RAML document:

  sum 1 + 1

We will see that the value of `sum` will be evaluated as 2.

  data = RAML.eval(@text)

  data.assert == {:sum=>2}
